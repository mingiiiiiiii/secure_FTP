Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) is a key agreement protocol that allows two parties, each having an elliptic-curve public–private key pair, to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.
[1][2][3] This shared secret may be directly used as a key, or to derive another key. 
The key, or the derived key, can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric-key cipher. 
It is a variant of the Diffie–Hellman protocol using elliptic-curve cryptography.
